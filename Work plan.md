A preliminary plan for the project is as follows:

1. Formalise the properties of the simulated WSNs, with constraints I make and guarantees I expect. (2 weeks)

2. Installing and setup of the development environment. (1 week) 

3. Begin development on the core features of the algorithm by the following steps. (8 weeks)
    1. Specification
    2. Development
    3. Validation

4. When the algorithm works for the core features, I'll add more features and follow the same workflow as in 3. (7 weeks)

5. Polishing the implementation and finalising the report. (2 weeks)

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project.
