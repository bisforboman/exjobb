# Introduction

_Simply an introduction to the project. The headers below might be redudant..._

## Background

## Purpose

## Limitations

_What stuff do I disregard?_

# Problem Definition
_Here the problems/questions that should be answered or dealt with throughout the project be formulated._

The master thesis will aim to answer the following questions throughout the project:

* Will better privacy be achieved?
* Does the changes demand new mechanisms to sustain the same level of security? 
  * What new attacks does the new implementations make possible?
  * What other demands does this place on the network?
* What is a decision?
* How should a decision be formulated?

### Privacy/Security

_A general description of the two and the differences between them. Then explain how I view them in my project._

### Decisions 

_Explain what a decision is and it's importance to my project._

### ? 
_I probably need more headers..._

# Approach

_Will be similar to the previous approach section except it will be rewritten to match the problem definition._

# Timetable

_Will consist of a gant-schedule and explanation of the different sections in it._

1. Formalise the properties of the simulated WSNs, with constraints I make and guarantees I expect. (2 weeks)

2. Installing and setup of the development environment. (1 week) 

3. Begin development on the core features of the algorithm by the following steps. (8 weeks)
    1. Specification
    2. Development
    3. Validation

4. When the algorithm works for the core features, I'll add more features and follow the same workflow as in 3. (7 weeks)

5. Polishing the implementation and finalising the report. (2 weeks)

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project.
