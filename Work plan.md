# Introduction

_Simply an introduction to the project._

# Problem Definition

_Here the problems/questions that should be answered or dealt with throughout the project be formulated._

# Approach

_Will be similar to the previous approach section except it will be rewritten to match the problem definition._

# Timetable

_Will consist of a gant-schedule and explanation of the different sections in it._

# Previous 
_Previous planning report, will mainly be used in the timetable._

1. Formalise the properties of the simulated WSNs, with constraints I make and guarantees I expect. (2 weeks)

2. Installing and setup of the development environment. (1 week) 

3. Begin development on the core features of the algorithm by the following steps. (8 weeks)
    1. Specification
    2. Development
    3. Validation

4. When the algorithm works for the core features, I'll add more features and follow the same workflow as in 3. (7 weeks)

5. Polishing the implementation and finalising the report. (2 weeks)

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project.
