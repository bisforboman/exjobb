# Papers

This document will contain other good reads that could be useful in the report/proposal of onwards in the project. Only listed the ones I found useful in some sense that I haven't added yet.

## Surveys

### Wireless Sensor networks: a survey

link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128601003024

Lists several usages for WSNs. Might be good for finding areas to investigate.

### Evolution of Wireless Sensor Networks towards the Internet of Things: a Survey

TBR.

## Symposiom Issue (?)

### Privacy in the Big Age of Data

link: https://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/big-data (faulty protocol atm)

Short read on arguments on collecting Big Data. Could be useful but kinda narrow aswell, only a discussion-starter I guess.

## Papers

### Sensing as a Service and Big Data

link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X13000241

Discusses WSNs and how to approach development to meet future needs, not as focused on privacy/security though, so keeping it here for now.

### Public Key Based Cryptoschemes for Data
Concealment in Wireless Sensor Networks

link: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4024506

TBR.

### Preserving Source Location Privacy in
Monitoring-Based Wireless Sensor Networks

link: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=1639682
