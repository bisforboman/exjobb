# Week 35

Next week's objectives are prioritized in ascending order. The writing task has been crossed out since we said it wasn't as important but should'd written some on the Specification instead.

## Last week's objectives

### Tasks

* Adding some more properties to the models (like Liveness)

* Code-generation, finding a good program for it and use it on some models.

### Thesis

* Some re-arranging of the outline. 

* ~~Write sections on the background (define decisions, overcollection and the problem).~~

### Successes

The outline is better now, still has some chapters missing but the flow is easier to follow now I think. 

Liveness was added to the model but currently feels redundant in it's definition. (question on this).

### Setbacks

Need to write more on the 'Specification' (what have been done so far). Prioritized outline higher last week and should perhaps have given myself more time to it.

Code generation was investigated(from the paper 'End to End verifcation using SPIN') but I haven't installed any software.

Also, being ill sucks.

## Specific questions

* I want to discuss the Liveness property currently being used. I might have misunderstood when discussing it but currently it feels redundant. Currently only added it to "Decentralized model with multiple nodes" since I'm uncertain of it.

* Some discussion of the outline is still helpful, if it has improved now or not and how I can be better.

## Work plan for the following week (next week's objectives)

### Tasks

* Discuss half-time presentation with Wolfgang (find a date etc.) 

* Promela to C -generation.

### Thesis

* Write the section regarding "Defining the Models" and the "Initial Model" (rename?)

* Write the section on the LTL properties used in the 'Initial Model'.

* If rework on outline is required I should be done aswell.
