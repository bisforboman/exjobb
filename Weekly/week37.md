# Week 37

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Discuss half-time presentation with Wolfgang (find a date etc.) 

### Thesis

* Write the section regarding "Defining the Models" and the "Initial Model" (rename?)

* ~~If rework on outline is required I should be done aswell.~~

### Successes

For now I'm satisfied with the outline so I'm keeping it as it is for now. I've written a good piece on the models(on paper) and am spending the tuesday with adding it to the github.

### Setbacks

* Write the section on the LTL properties used in the 'Initial Model'.

I didn't that to write that much on the LTL models, reading up and writing on how I should explain the models took a lot of time.

* Promela to C -generation.

I only focused on writing for this week since it felt the most urgent so I didn't feel that generate the C-code would help continue the work.

## Specific questions

No specific questions until I get answer from Wolfgang. 

## Work plan for the following week

I assume I should begin preparing for the mid-term here so only focusing on the report and eventually presenting soon.
