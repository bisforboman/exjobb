# Week 49

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Draft for "Dist_disj_dec" is now finished, working on verifying it now. Seems I need to reformulate properties (...)

### Thesis

* Main focus has been on revising chapter 3, the parts have a new flow and should present some sections in a better manner. 

### Successes & Setbacks

(Both) Finished my draft for the new variation, that's completely different from the first example, but I haven't run any verification on it. 

## Specific questions

I'd like to discuss the properties for the verifications, since I think they'll be a tricky part for the additional dimensions/variations of the network. I guess the same "base" as used before can be used but perhaps they need to be extended? Or do I just need to change my model to suit them?

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Finish additional variations of the network. (focus on the differences between the two models I now have since they are "opposites")

### Thesis

* Revise background chapter (chapter 2)
