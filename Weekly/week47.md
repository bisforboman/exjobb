# Week 47

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Created behavior models for the new variations. (currently working on new FSMs)

### Thesis

* Added new images for the old FSM-figures in the report. (Still working on a behavior model template)
* Rewritten almost all of the commented parts in the report. (mainly fixed typos and text corresponding to the new images)

### Successes & Setbacks

## Specific questions

I'd like to discuss the new FSMs images added, to make they correspond correctly.

Also I'd like to discuss the new behavior models I'll bring on paper.

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Complete FSMs for the new variations.
* Finish drafts for the new variations (in promela, should have an finish idea how they should look even if some parts aren't working 100%).

### Thesis

* Focusing on the arguing parts of the report such as: ยง1.5 Limitations (p. 1), ยง4.1 Modeling in Promela.
