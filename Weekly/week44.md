# Week 43

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Liveness-proof (?)

### Thesis

* Aim & Limitations (50%)

* Catch up on the design-chapter from week 41. (? %)

### Successes & Setbacks

(Success) Greatly reduced the number of states/transitions in the model now. 

(Both) Written about half what I expect to be capture in the Aim & Limitations, feels a bit thin but it's what I could come up with that I think should be captured there.

(Setback) The liveness property is acting wierd when trying to verify it. I think my settings in JSpin is correct but I don't see why it considers my run to fail (I uploaded a trail in Models/FaultyRuns/simple_model_liveness_fail.pml). The property currently uses an additional ghost variable since our discussion of overcollection last week changed the model.

## Specific questions

* Aim & Limitations - I'd like to discuss what I think should be there and if you have input on what else could/should be added.

* Liveness - if you could check the trail (or you could probably just verify it yourself and get the same result) and see why it says it fails. From the status of the program in the last state seems to be fine.

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* If we come up with anything during the meeting, I'll add it afterwards. I don't have anything for now and I need to spend more time writing the report at this stage.

### Thesis

* Aim & Limitations

* Design-chapter

* Definitions - Decisions
