# Week 48

Done some changes to the repository, e.g. old files that has been used before will put in the folder "cold_storage" and if I don't think they ever will be useful they will be removed entirely. This is just to tidy up some directories.

## What has been done

### Tasks

* A draft for a "decentralized disjunctive distributed"-network is uploaded: "Models/Variations/dec_disj_dist.pml"

### Thesis

* Spent time each day reading on Hamid's report (ongoing item).

* The thesis can now be previewable in .tex on the github at under "Thesis". 

* Chapter 3 - Models & Specification has been partially revised, I'm currently working what are now comments under "Specification". 

* Using PlantUML for my behavior-illustrations. Still have one example to fix (the 'WSN illustration') and going to fix it today.

### Successes & Setbacks

(Success) Merged my overleaf-thesis report writing into gitHub and planned on storing it on both servers but overleaf didn't support .pml-files so finally giving up and installing a .tex-editor locally instead.

(Both) Have gotten some progress with a "decentralized disjunctive distributed"-example. Some aspects aren't finished yet since I still considering each entities purpose (e.g. should the server manage the decision-communication?)

## Specific questions

Nodes in a Distributed setting - I'd like to discuss how a node should work in a distributed setting more specifically (like how it should look as an automaton). Basically a general discussion on the "distributed variation" would be helpful.

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Continue working with the variations.

### Thesis

* Finish a revised version for Chapter 3.

* If finished with that, continue with Chapter 2.
