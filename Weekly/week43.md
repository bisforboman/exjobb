# Week 43

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Write ~~induction~~ -proof for correctness

### Thesis

* Scope & Limitations

### Successes & Setbacks

(Success) Begun writing the scope and limitations and think I got some idea what I want there, but unsure if I should keep the "aim" section or if I should rename it to "Limitations" instead and just mention what I don't will focus on.

(Both) Made a draft for a proof for the correctness, but currently I have no induction-step for it. I think though with what I have is a general step, meaning it should manage any number of requesting nodes.

## Specific questions

Wondering if the proof-draft I made covers enough, if the case is valid with my assertion or if I'm missing something (been a while since I did proofs like this). And if an induction step is required.

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Liveness-proof (?)

### Thesis

* Write on definitions: Decisions, Over-Collection, etc.

* Scope & Limitations

* Catch up on the design-chapter from week 41.
