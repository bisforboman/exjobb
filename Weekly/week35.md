# Week 35

## What has been done

### Tasks
* Written and tested what I think is a proper correctness property. The output from testing is a bit confusing but from what I see it seems correct. Going to include the output next meeting.

### Thesis
* Done a detailed outline and begun to add text to some core parts. 

* Merged parts of the proposal into the 'outline.md' (the report).

* Written a section on the problem study. 

### Successes

I think most part were successfull, but perhaps the section regarding the problem study was a tad short.

### Setbacks

I'm not satisfied with the Outline, the one I have now I would call a scratch. I'm uncertain which order I should have sections, so I make it easier to the reader to understand. I'm gonna spend some time re-arranging this next week aswell.

## Specific questions

* I have a question regarding SPINs output when I'm testing the properties. From Wolfgang's notes I should get some information I dont seem to be getting.

* I'd like a discussion on a logical order on an outline, I which order I can present things. 

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Adding some more properties to the models (like Likeness)

* Code-generation, finding a good program for it and use it on some models.

### Thesis

* Some re-arranging of the outline. 

* Write sections on the background (define decisions, overcollection and the problem).
