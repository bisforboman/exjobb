# Week 43

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Removed the global variables from the models and instead have properties on the states (by the use of labels).

### Thesis

* Written some on the design, haven't argued enough for the translation yet, mainly described the code. (ยง4.2?)

* Completed a draft for the Aim & Limitations

* Rewritten specification since the properties have changed, should probably be a bit more "wordy".

### Successes & Setbacks

(Success) Properties work for one node at the moment, with the changes. Haven't tested it properly with more nodes (since the current version of the properties only looks at node#1)

(Success) Finalized some writing that's been delayed.

## Specific questions

Are the current properties well-defined? (Maybe they should have an always-clause, but then the system needs to constantly collect from what I can see) If they are I'll try to extend the properties for more nodes.

## Work plan for the following week

Anything that comes up during the meeting will be focused on for next week aswell.

### Tasks

* Begin developing the extended models.

### Thesis

* Argue for design-chapter.
