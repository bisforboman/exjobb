# Week 42

Last week went poorly, when I finish this week's items I'll continue with what I didn't finish last week.

## What has been done

### Tasks

* Abstract(/reduce) the model so I can test it for larger sets of collection nodes. Currently only 3 is verifiable.

* Define 'Correctness' ~~and 'Liveness'~~

### Thesis

* ~~Write the known parts of the design-chapter (first two sections). Comparing SPIN to UPPAAL, if more are required they could be added later. ~~

* ~~Write on 'Scope & Limitations'~~

### Successes & Setbacks

_(Both)_ Finally I think my models are working (partially). Has taken almost all time since last week, currently stating invariants on it. But I still get 1000+ states when verifying for 3 nodes which I think is too much.

_(Setback)_ I have barely worked on my thesis since models are most prioritized and they weren't working.

## Specific questions

I'd like to discuss the iSpin configuration, since partially my problem was I had used the wrong settings. I'd like to make sure so further verifying will go easier.

## Work plan for the following week

### Tasks

* Finish loop-invariants and write and a draft of an induction-proof before friday.

### Thesis

* Scope & Limitations
