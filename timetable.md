## Timetable

The Gant Schedule can be viewed in an attachment to this document. Below the individual topics are described. The schedule describes an interative agile process, where I'll start by developing a version with only some core features and once that's done I will seek to add additional features. 

### Administration

The work is first planned out and described in this planning report and the mandatory lectures are estimated, since I'm not sure of their dates yet. 

### Theoretical Study

This section covers the formulation of the problem and planning on how the networks will look. I estimate I will need three initial weeks of specificing this and understanding how I wish to go about to solve it. The goal here would be to define a mathematical model I can use for the design-process. 

One week is also expected for this when adding additional features. 

### Practical Study

This is where most of the project's time will be spent. The schedules roughly describes the order which the steps will be carried out but an iterative process is expected for some parts. When the problem is specified I estimate some time will be spent chosing and setting up the development environment, but no more than a week. I will most likely use SPIN for this since I have used it before and it should suit my needs. 

### Documentation

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project. Therefore it's shown in the gant schedule as an item for basically every week. 

### Presentations

When half the project is completed - hopefully when a working example is completed - a mid presentation is planned for presenting the work. If a smaller mid-presentation is preferred I will devote more time to the practical studies. 

At the end of the work, a final presentation is also planned for presenting the master thesis.
