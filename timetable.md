## Timetable

The Gant Schedule can be viewed in an attachment to this document. Below the individual topics are described.

### Administration

The work is first planned out and described in this planning report and the mandatory lectures are estimated. Also some lectures will be attended after the span of the gant schedule. 

### Theoretical Study

This section covers the formalizing and planning on how the theoretical networks will look. Also the decisions will be intially formalized here to have a starting point to work with when implementing them. This definition will likely be revised later on in the project. 

Also when the core features are implemented, I will look at adding possible extensions which are also covered in this section. 

### Implementation

This is the core of the project, where the workflow will first be to construct a code skeleton to work from. The skeleton will define the procedures required for handling the decisions and also contain the other features of the WSN. When this is done, the development will begin. Finally I will validate the work so it works as intended. 

### Documentation

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project. Therefore it's shown in the gant schedule as item for basically every week. 

### Presentation

When half the project is completed - hopefully when a working example is completed - a mid presentation is planned for presenting the work. 

At the end of the work, a final presentation is also planned for presenting the master thesis.
