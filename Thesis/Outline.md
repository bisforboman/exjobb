# Master Thesis

## Abstract

The presence of connected devices in our environment is increasing. These devices form a network often called Internet of Things (or IoT for short), where everything from lightbulbs to thermostats can be controlled by an app or by another device. These services make a lot of that data available to the end user but also to malicious parties due to the devices leaking more data than intended or by bad design. This puts the end user at risk, violating its privacy and leaking sensitive data. One simple and obvious way to prevent leakages and misuses of personal data is to collect less of this data, a principle known as data minimisation. However, this solution is rarely used in practice because of business models relying on personal data harvest on one hand and because of the difficulty to enforce it once it is defined what is actually needed to provide a service.

## Introduction

In this thesis I investigated ways to improve privacy in a special kind of IoT devices known as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSN are networks of autonomous sensors and actuators. The goal to enhance privacy for this kind of devices will be addressed by relying on data minimisation. This means the project will seek to improve privacy in distributed networks by limiting the amount of personal data processed. 

First, in this report I will define some characteristics of the problem. Then with these definitions I will proceed to explaining the development process. Finally I will discuss the validation of the development in a conclusion of the thesis.
