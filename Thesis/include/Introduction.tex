\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Motivation}

\section{Aim}

%The purpose of this thesis is improve privacy in \wsns, in the sense that minimizing the amount of personal data being processed reduces the amount of data being communicated in the network. Different versions of \wsns will be considered and analyzed to reach a general solution as possible. 

%The project also seeks to formalize the meaning of overcollection and what it means in the setting of \wsns collecting personal data. 

This thesis will investigate ways to improve privacy in a special kind of IoT (Internet of Things) devices known as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). WSN are networks of autonomous sensors and actuators. The goal to enhance privacy for this kind of devices will be addressed by relying on data minimization. This means the project sought to improve privacy in distributed networks by limiting the amount of personal data being processed.

To achieve this, the project sought to accomplish the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Define Over-Collection and it's meaning with regards to this project. 
\item Construct a model of an example of a \wsn that stops the collection when Over-Collection is occuring.
\item Implement (or generate) a C-implementation from the models and analyze them.
\end{itemize} % C-implementation?



%maybe add some list with goals?

\section{Limitations}

% faulty wsns
The project will not consider faulty behaviors of a \wsn, meaning that the systems and algorithms will work under the assumption that all messages sent are received and all units are working as intended without malfunctions.

% time complexity
Only the result of the data collection will be analyzed in the sought outcome and if time complexity of the algorithm will be an issue for the project, it will not be considered as a failure should it arise. Some analysis will be done but it won't be a main focus to minifor the project.

% data collection
Only the privacy aspects of collecting personal data will be considered throughout the thesis and the aspect of storing and managing it will be outside the scope of this thesis.

% time vs states
Any model properties related to time (in the sense that they can be measured numerically) will be treated on an abstract level or be disregarded.\todo{this section is borrowed from another MT where a quote was also included from Ben-Ari's book from 2008. I thought it was relevant for me aswell} %borrowed from other thesis, referred to Ben-Ari 2008 p. 173.

% attackers
% include that attack vectors and stuff are outside the scope of the project?

%The project seeks to model and verify an overcollecting system and investigate 

%\textit{in this section I will explain what questions the project sought/didn't seek to answer and what problems it did and didn't attempt to solve.}

% define overcollection formally
