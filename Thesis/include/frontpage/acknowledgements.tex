Furthermore for behind a key role as a discussion partner and increasing my knowledge in this area, I hope you're having a good time back in France! Also I want to thank David Sands for stepping up and being my supervisor the last months of my project. 

Lastly I want to thank Wolfgang Ahrendt, in his role as an examiner for this project and for making it possible. %Also for taking the time to finding me a new supervisor so close to the end of the project.
