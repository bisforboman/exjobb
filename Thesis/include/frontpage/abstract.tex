With the world becoming more and more digitalized, the collection of personal data from users becomes a growing concern. When data is collected and aggrevated to be accessed remotely, it makes it easier for adversaries to access information in a low-risk and anonymous manner. Data Minimization is a practical way to prevent leakages of personal data, to not collect more than is directly relevant, but it's a practice rarely used. \\ 

In this thesis we will investigate Over-Collection in a commonly used technology namely \wsn, and use Data Minimization as a tool to prevent this. We will describe our process of using Model Checking, present some revisions it yielded and the resulting Promela models. Even though this project sought to achieve a more extensive model, it's findings can still be useful for related work into Model Checking and Data Minimization.



%The presence of connected devices in our environment is increasing. 

%and specifically Wireless Sensor Networks is often used for gathering personal data.

%These devices form a network often called Internet of Things (or IoT for short), where everything from light-bulbs to thermostats can be controlled by an app or by another device. 

%These services make a lot of that data available to the end user but also to malicious parties due to the devices leaking more data than intended or by bad design. This puts the end user at risk, violating its privacy and leaking sensitive data. One simple and obvious way to prevent leakages and misuses of personal data is to collect less of this data, a principle known as data minimization. However, this solution is rarely used in practice because of business models relying on personal data harvest on one hand and because of the difficulty to enforce it once it is defined what is actually needed to provide a service.
