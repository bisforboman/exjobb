\chapter{Implementation}

%(1) discuss the different ways to verify implementation and explain why the one you chose is the one which seems the more suitable (for example, you could derive your implementation from your FSA models, but also from Promela/SPIN models, and you should compare the pros and cons of each way to do it), 

%(2) explain how you applied the chosen technique and what you got, and 

%(3) discuss the limitations of your current models (for instance, it could be that the code is not optimized because it has been automatically generated, preventing to do low-level hacks to manage memory for instance, or it could contain some redundancy and does not show an intuitive modularization ...)

\textit{Discuss different approaches to verify the implementation and argue for the one I decided on.}

\section{Code Generation}

\textit{Decide on a tool, discuss it}

\section{Satisfaction}

\textit{Explain how I used my approach to verify the implementation}

\section{Analysis}

\textit{Analyze the result of the generation and discuss limitations on the current models. E.g. redundancy from the generation or weaknesses in terms of security}
