# Faulty Runs in SPIN

This document explains the different files in this folder.


## simple_model_v1.pml.trail

Shows the trail of a faulty run, but the end-state is not valid and I can't find why SPIN can make this as an "end state" when the program flow doesn't allow this behavior. *or does it? Not from what I can see.*
