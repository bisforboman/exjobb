## Timetable

The Gant Schedule can be viewed in an attachment to this document. Below the individual topics are described. The schedule describes an interative agile process, where I'll start by developing a version with only some core features and once that's done I will seek to add additional features. 

### Administration

The work is first planned out and described in this planning report and the mandatory lectures are estimated, since I'm not sure of their dates yet. 

### Theoretical Study

This section covers the time spent for formulating of the problem and planning on how the wireless sensor networks will look. I estimate I will need three initial weeks of specificing this and understanding how I wish to go about to solve it. The goal here would be to define a mathematical model I can use later for the design-process. Here I also aim to decide which programming language I will implement my solution in. 

Also one week is noted here, later in the project, which is the expected time for re-specifying the model for the additional features.

### Practical Study

This is where most of the project's time will be spent. The schedules roughly describes the order which the steps will be carried out but iterative processes are expected for some parts. When the problem is specified I estimate some time will be spent chosing and setting up the development environment, but no more than a week. During this week I will also decide which program I will be using, to allow some research into this and comparing different possibilities. At this stage I'm leaning towards using SPIN, since from my experiences it suits my needs, but to not get to narrow-sighted I'll look into alternatives. 

Next up is to start designing the algorithms and then proving certain properties. This is one of the aforementioned iterative processes where if the models are proven faulty, the work will be retracted to the design step. Therefore in the gant schedule, these steps are partially overlapping. When a proven working model is achieved, some work will be put into analysing its performance. This is due to the code is supposed to run in a wireless sensor network where costly implementations could prove unusable. 

Finally comes the time for implementation of the algorithm and with both the model and the design at hand, it's estimated to take one week of my time. After implementing the algorithm I've also designated one week for validation to make sure it's working as intended. 

These steps describe the entire process, once I've reached this stage. I'll reformulate the problem with more features and then repeat the steps described here in this section once again to reach the final result. 

### Documentation

Writing of the final report is interleaved with the other work throughout the entire project. Therefore it's shown in the gant schedule as an item for basically every week. For this to work smoothly I aim to devote one day of the week to just documentation and writing the report.

### Presentations

When half the project is completed - hopefully when a working example is completed - a mid presentation is planned for presenting the work. If a smaller mid-presentation is preferred I will devote more time to the practical studies. 

At the end of the work, a final presentation is also planned for presenting the master thesis.
