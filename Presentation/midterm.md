# Midterm Presentation

This document is just some notes to help present the part of the work leading up to the midterm presentation in the master thesis.

## Progress

I think the overall progress is fine, I fell behind the weeks around my re-exams but I have progressed good since then and I think I'm where I expected to be during the midterm. *Maybe just say I think I am where I expected to be?*



## Coming up

Next part will be the implementation, where I will use a code-generation tool to generate C-code from my promela code on the different models. 

## Relate to the work plan

### Theoretical Study

#### Study the problem

Most this week was spent looking at related articles for the work to see if I could find any other approaches to this problem. The best one I found was on 'Smart City'.

#### Formulatation of the problem

This part was more time-consuming than expected,

To help formulating the problem I approached the problem from another angle, perhaps not the best one but it helped me atleast. I started by formulating a simple dummy example where I wanted the 

#### Prove correctness

I had several attempts at the correctness proving, I believe my idea of the formula was correct but was poorly formulated the first times so the completion of it took longer than expected. Once I got the correct idea though it was applied to the model and it seems to work.

The correctness, as described in the report was formulated:

*When the decision is sent, the collection will eventually stop.*

Also liveness was added as a formula, this wasn't planned to be included in the first model but we decided it was a good idea to add it now. It was formulated as:

*The program shall collect until overcollection has occured.*

### Practical Study

#### Design

#### Analyse and rework
